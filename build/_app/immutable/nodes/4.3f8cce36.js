When, where, and why did conceptions of race come into being? How might learning about its history help us better understand the complex role that race plays in our lives today?</p> <p>Centuries before the term race came into popular use, people around the world used distinctions like language, dress, class, geography, and religion—in addition to traits like skin color or facial features—to categorize each other. Seeing Race Before Race explores these early expressions of race in medieval and early modern Europe between 1100 and 1800.</p> <p>Seeing Race Before Race is generously supported by the Carl &amp; Marilynn Thoma Foundation, the Samuel H.
