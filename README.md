# Seeing Race Before Race

Race is a powerful and challenging concept. It is a social construction that affects our lives in ways both obvious and practically invisible. When, where, and why did conceptions of race come into being? How might learning about its history help us better understand the complex role that race plays in our lives today?

## RaceB4Race

Seeing Race Before Race draws on the pathbreaking work of our partners in the RaceB4Race research collective. Founded in 2019, RaceB4Race centers the expertise, perspectives, and sociopolitical interests of scholars who are Black, Indigenous, and of color to demonstrate the value of premodern critical race studies and highlight the powerful histories of people of color in the classical, medieval, and early modern past.
